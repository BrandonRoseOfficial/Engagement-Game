# Engagement-Game
A project I started in September of 2018 to code a video game that I would later use to propose to my fiance. This game utilizes HTML, Vanilla JavaScript, Node.js, Parcel.js, and the Phaser 3 framework. Stage design, music, and sprites were also created by me. Bug fixes and updates will be made occasionally. 

Game source code can be found in the src/scenes/

The game can be run by using either parcel & node.js to bundle it via the terminal
